				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>My journey has taken me from leading young people and teaching bands and drum lines around Texas to making websites and web applications for everyone. As I continue to grow as a developer, I would love to work alongside a collaborative team that values education and community.</p>
				<p>In my previous positions, I was able to practice daily public speaking and leading groups of all sizes through a variety of projects. I remain excited about education and hope to use my influence to make my community a better place each day.</p>
